/// Golden-master equivalence test for the TextCorrector term-casing refactor
/// (Phase 3). Expected values were captured from the pre-refactor implementation
/// (per-pattern `replacingOccurrences(options: .regularExpression)`) and are locked
/// here so the compiled-regex rewrite is provably behavior-preserving.
///
/// NOTE: some expected outputs contain quirks that live in passes NOT touched by the
/// refactor (e.g. "Next.Js" — the sentence-capitalizer treats "." in "Next.js" as a
/// sentence end; "IPad"/"IOS" — sentence-start capitalization overrides brand casing).
/// They are locked deliberately: the refactor must not change them.
